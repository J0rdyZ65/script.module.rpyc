		<description lang="en">
RPyC (pronounced like are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a transparent library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering, and distributed-computing.
RPyC makes use of object-proxying, a technique that employs python.s dynamic nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between processes and computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they were local.
